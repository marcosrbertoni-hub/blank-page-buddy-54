     *      water 2.0, puddles 1.9 — all of them were being replaced by 0.52 before they drew).
     *

     * (`scene.environmentIntensity = envSpecularBase`), the module's requested level is
     * re-applied to the diffuse half only (`uIblDiffuse`), and each material's authored
     * `envMapIntensity` is restored as its own specular gain (`uEnvSpec`). Diffuse irradiance is
